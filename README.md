You don't need any additional knowledge to get this going:
- install and activate the plugin located in the system folder
- go to the Widgetkit component and click on "Use K2"
- you will be presented with the already familiar options of:
    - which contents to select from K2 and what part of those contents to display
    - how to display the selected contents in WidgetKit

Requirements
------------
K2 Content module (included in your K2 installation) must be installed but not necessarily activated
